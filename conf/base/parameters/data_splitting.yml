# Data Splitting Pipeline Parameters
# Processes images with ch03 channel in filename from patches/mt directories
# Saves tabular data in tabular/ subdirectory and images in images/ subdirectory
# Always copies images and saves as parquet format
# Always includes sample_name and roi_name for cell identification

# Input/Output paths
data_splitting_feature_path: "data/04_feature/feature_data.parquet"
data_splitting_image_dir: "data/04_feature"
data_splitting_output_dir: "data/05_model_input"

# Data splitting configuration
data_splitting:
  # Split sizes (must sum to <= 1.0)
  test_size: 0.2    # 20% for testing
  val_size: 0.2     # 20% for validation
  # train_size is calculated as: 1.0 - test_size - val_size = 0.6 (60%)

  # Random seed for reproducibility
  random_state: 42

  # Column names
  label_column: "gfp_status"    # Target variable
  sample_column: "sample_name"  # Sample identifier (always included)
  roi_column: "roi_name"        # ROI identifier (always included)

  # Image filtering (only process ch03 images)
  channel_filter: "ch03"  # Only process images with this channel identifier in filename

# Data splitting parameters for ML pipeline

# Target column name in the dataset
target_column: "gfp_status"

# Test set size (proportion of total data)
test_size: 0.2

# Validation set size (proportion of remaining data after test split)
val_size: 0.1

# Random state for reproducible splits
random_state: 42

# Stratification settings
stratify: true

# Additional splitting parameters
shuffle: true
